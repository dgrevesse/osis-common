This script is used to make initial migrations of data between osis and osis portal
It has to be used when data already exists in osis or osis-portal and one
of these project was used alone whitout the second one.
The script functions have to be launched from common line 'dbshell' in osis or osis-portal environnment.
Migrations are made trough the queue system
